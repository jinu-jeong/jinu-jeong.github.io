## About me

Hello, world! My name is Jinu Jeong (정진우), and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. My research focuses on data-driven molecular dynamics simulation and reduced order modeling. I'm particularly interested in the following areas:

- Simulation acceleration
- Data-driven physics modeling
- Corae-grained molecular dynamics simulation
- FEM model reduction

## Education

- University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

  PhD in Mechanical Science and Engineering, 2024 Summer (Expected)
- Seoul National University

  Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, 2019
- University of Ulsan
  
  Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, 2017

## Projects


- [Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10865): Extended DeepILST
