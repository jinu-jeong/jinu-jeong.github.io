## About me

Hello, world! My name is Jinu Jeong (정진우), and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering. My research focuses on data-driven molecular dynamics simulation and reduced order modeling. I'm particularly interested in the following areas:

- Simulation acceleration
- Data-driven physics modeling
- Corae-grained molecular dynamics simulation
- FEM model reduction

## Education

- University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<br />PhD in Mechanical Science and Engineering, 2024 Summer (Expected)

- Seoul National University<br />Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, 2019

- University of Ulsan<br />Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, 2017

## Projects


- [Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c10865)<br />Our team developed a neural network that predicts the equivalent dimensionless Lennard-Jones potential parameters for a multi-atom system. This was used to perform a coarse-grained simulation, which accurately reproduced the microscopic structure (RDF) of various simple fluids at different thermodynamic states.

- [FEM acceleration, Solid-fluid interaction](https://dcollection.snu.ac.kr/common/orgView/000000156565)<br />I developed an accelerated finite element method (FEM) for Brownian dynamics simulation of solvated proteins. By implementing static condensation and component mode synthesis approaches, our simulation achieved high acceleration while minimizing accuracy loss.

- [Nano mechanics, Numerical analysis](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE06666531)<br />Using molecular dynamics simulation, we developed a numerical model that utilizes composite beam theory to explain the relation between surface elastic properties and the corresponding natural frequency of FCC nano-beams.

- Image detection<br />An image detection model is developed to detect semiconductor defects. We employed the single shot multi-box detector (SSD) and trained it to identify semiconductor defects by comparing blueprint and microscopy images of wafers. Our method exceeded the performance of the current state-of-the-art defect detection approach.

- End to end coarse-graining framework : ongoing

- Data driven modeling of quantum force : ongoing
